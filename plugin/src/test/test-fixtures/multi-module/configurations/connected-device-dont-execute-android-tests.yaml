# This test was added in reaction to fixing:
# https://github.com/NeoTech-Software/Android-Root-Coverage-Plugin/issues/90
#
# When no Gradle Managed Devices are configured in combination with not allowing the plugin to
# execute androidTests (executeAndroidTests=false), the plugin would cause a Gradle error like:
#
# > Task with path ':app:allDevicesDebugAndroidTest' not found in project ':app'
#
# This test makes sure this configuration combination does not result in any errors.

# This test was added in reaction to:
# https://github.com/NeoTech-Software/Android-Root-Coverage-Plugin/issues/83
#
# Currently this test case fails, but probably not because of this plugin as it seems to be
# an Android tooling issue:
# - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/126258801
# - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/123987001
#
# For now this test configuration is ignored (until Google fixes this)
